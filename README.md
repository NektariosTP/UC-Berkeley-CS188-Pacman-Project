# UC Berkeley CS188 Pacman Projects

The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. 

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Included

1. **Project 0 - Introduction**: This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the Python programming language and the UNIX environment.
2. **Project 1 - Search**: Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
3. **Project 2 - Multi-Agent Search**: Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
